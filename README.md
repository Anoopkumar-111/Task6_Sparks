# Task6_Sparks

HELLO EVERYONE , I've completed my Selenium Automation Scripting task (TASK 6) as a Web Development Intern under GRADUATE ROTATIONAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (i.e) GRIP by the Sparks Foundation. 

In this project I used Selenium to create a test case to test the website thesparksfoundation.sg.
